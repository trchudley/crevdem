# Downloading the GrIMP mask and BedMachine

ArcticDEM and REMA strips are available as cloud-optimised GeoTIFFs (CoGs) on Amazon Web Services, so we can download them on the fly. The same is not true, however, for the NSIDC data products that are required to be available locally to complete geoid correction and filtering of non-glacial regions. These include the BedMachine Greenland v5 or BedMachine Antarctica v3 respectively (Morlighem _et al._ 2022a, 2022b) and, for Greenland, the GrIMP ice mask (Howat, 2017) for bedrock filtering. File or directory paths will be requested in the relevant functions.

These can be downloaded from the NSIDC manually ([Greenland BedMachine](https://doi.org/10.5067/GMEVBWFLWA7X), [Antarctic BedMachine](https://doi.org/10.5067/FPSU0V1MWUB6), [Greenland surface mask](https://doi.org/10.5067/B8X58MQBFUPA)) but for conveninence, download scripts are provided in this directory. The BedMachine download scripts are provided by the NSIDC, and require an Earthdata user account and password to be provided. The files will be downloaded into the directory the scripts are run.
